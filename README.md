# ML-based Marketing
## Relevance
Small businesses, like larger enterprises regardless of size, must give careful consideration to the creation of their marketing plan. However, there are many factors that complicate the development of a marketing strategy. As a result, using various ML-based technologies and engaging of AI in marketing is a trend that is spreading rapidly.
The purpose of the recommender system is to inform the user about the product that he may be most interested in at a given time. The client receives information, and the service earns by providing quality assistance. Services are not necessarily direct sales of the product offered. The service can also earn on commissions or simply increase user loyalty, which then translates into advertising and other income.
The project, related to the construction of a recommender system, allows to select a subgroup of people who are most exposed to advertising, marketing programs, promotions, discounts based on client data. As a starting data, the system has a dataset provided by the partner company.

## Goal
Implement a tool that detects the subgroup of people who are most sensitive to marketing campaigns.
